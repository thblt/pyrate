Pyrate todo
-----------

1. Add a configuration setting to give up root privileges (required to start on 80) after server is initialized.
2. Improve upload speed, currently much faster and less-CPU eating using ssh than Pyrate.  
3. Implement running over lighttpd (*May* fix #2)
4. Implement sorting on file displays
5. Add a configuration option to sort folders first
6. Provide identification of file type (use .phone-hidden)
