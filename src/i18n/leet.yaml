    <p> A PirateBox is a simple tool to share files with your friends. 
      May it be movies, texts, radio broadcasts, ... you can add or download as many files you want!
      In order to keep things clean, please send your files in the relevant directories and sub-directories.
    </p>
    
    <p>In the UEEH, be it at the Crous, at the faculty or on the PirateBox, please respect the charter!
    </p>
    
    <p>To learn more about the PirateBox, from the origins of the project to its relevance in the UEEH, through its detailed functionment,
      see you at the presentation workshop that will be announced on the planning!
      Come with your questions, remarks, issues or glitters!
